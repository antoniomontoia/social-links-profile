## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Usage of Lists and Links: I refreshed my understanding of how to effectively use HTML lists (<ul> and <li>) and links (<a>). I learned how to style them to create a visually appealing layout while ensuring they remain functional.

```html

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/antoniomontoia">GitHub</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/antoniomontoia">Frontend Mentor</a></li>
    <li>LinkedIn</li>
    <li><a href="https://dribbble.com/franissimo">Dribbble</a></li>
    <li>Youtube</li>
</ul>

```

- Figma File Access: Not having access to the Figma file made it challenging to match the exact font weights and colors. This experience taught me the importance of having design resources readily available to ensure accuracy in implementation.

- Responsive Design: I solidified my understanding of responsive design principles. By using CSS properties like flex and calc(), I was able to create a layout that adapts well to different screen sizes.

```css

.container {
    width: 380px;
    padding: calc(24px + 0.8vw);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}

```

### Continued development

- CSS Grid: Next time, Iâ€™d like to explore CSS Grid for layout management. While I have a good grasp of Flexbox, I believe CSS Grid offers more flexibility for creating complex layouts.

- Advanced Responsive Design: I want to deepen my understanding of responsive design techniques, particularly media queries. I aim to learn how to create breakpoints that effectively adjust layouts and styles for various screen sizes.

- Accessibility : I plan to focus on improving the accessibility of my projects. This includes using semantic HTML, ensuring proper contrast ratios, and implementing ARIA roles where necessary.

- JavaScript Integration: I want to enhance my skills in integrating JavaScript with my HTML and CSS projects.
